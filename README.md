A streamlit app to analyze your whatsapp chats
This project is a Streamlit web application that allows you to upload and analyze your personal or group WhatsApp chat export files. It provides a comprehensive overview of communication patterns, user activity, and key statistics, making it easy to glean insights from your chat data.

# Key Features
Easy Upload: Quickly upload your exported WhatsApp chat (.txt) file for instant analysis.
Message Statistics: View total messages, most active users, word counts, media and link sharing statistics.
Interactive Visualizations: Explore message timelines, hourly and daily activity, and user contribution through various graphs and charts.
Text Analysis: Discover most common words, emojis, and topics discussed using frequency plots and word clouds.
User and Group Trends: Analyze participation, identify chat champions, and detect periods of highest activity.
Privacy Focused: All data is processed locally in your browser; no chat content is sent to external servers.

# How It Works
